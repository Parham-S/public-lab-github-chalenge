What should one do when darkens the sky?
When in the horizon enemies' sails arise?
What should one do when there is a need
To fool the approaching death, to do a hero's deed?
We rule the Seven Seas
Swords high for our Queen
Shout for what we live
Rum, women, victory
Shout for what we live
Rum, women, victory
What should one do when the answer's not there
On the highest mountain, or the deepest sea bed
What should one do if not fully alive
Face looming death with a grin and the nectar of courage
We rule the Seven Seas
Swords high for our Queen
Shout for what we live
Rum, women, victory
Shout for what we live
Rum, women, victory
We rule the Seven Seas
Swords high for our Queen
Shout for what we live
Rum, women, victory
Shout for what we live
Rum, women, victory
